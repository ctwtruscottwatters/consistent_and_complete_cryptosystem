systems approach
Basic Human Neuroanatomy

Gross Anatomy, Spinal Court, Autonomic Nervous System, Motor Systems, Sensory Systems, Brain Stem, Cranial Nerves and Cortex

By the end of this course:

Learn the gross anatomy of the central and peripheral nervous systems

Understand how sensory information enters the brain

Understand how the brain and spinal cord control the muscles

Understand how the autonomic nervous system activates the fight or flight response

Learn the names and functions of the cranial nerves



MASTERING anatomical concepts and structures takes a considerable amount of dedication.
time necessary for streaming and quizzing

Taking notes from lectures, flashcards?, drawing pictures of anatomical structures, retention

Central Nervous System (CNS) = Brain and spinal cord (parts of the nervous system encased in bone)
Nucleus = A group of neurons within the CNS with similar function, connectivity and neurotransmitters (part of the cell that contains DNA) 
Tract = A bundle of axons traveling together within the CNS, connecting two parts of the CNS 
Synapse = A point of connection/communication between neurons or neurons and their target organs
Afferent = Arriving information (means arriving) a cell, information coming to and from a particular neuron or arriving at a group of neurons
Efferent = Exiting information (exits a neuron, exits a nucleus or exits the CNS) 
Peripheral nervous system (PNS) = Cranial and peripheral nerves (all the stuff not inside bones) spinal nerves, things that go into all of your muscles
Nerve = A bundle of axons (plus associated connective tissue and blood vessels) located outside the brain and spinal cord. Similar to a tract. 
Ganglia = A group of neurons outside of the CNS with similar function, connectivity, and neurotransmitters. Ganglia are outside, nucleus is inside
Somatic Nervous system = Afferent and efferent systems that regulate the motor enervation of your skeletal muscles and the sensory information from your external environment. Somatics is the part of your nervous system of which you are aware,  
Afferent Nervous System = Afferent and efferent systems that regulate motor innervation of smooth muscle and sensory information from the internal environment. All of the things that move around on the inside

Dendrites are the receptive field of the neuron

Neurons do two things: fire or not fire

Information goes through their axon, travels and interacts with another target cell or target organ like a muscle or smooth muscle cell terminal buttons synapses.

Neurons make neurotransmitters

send them down the axon

to a synapse, grey matter and white matter

grey matter and white matter describe the gross anatomical structure of the CNS when its sectioned


Gray matter = neuronal cell bodies and proximal dendrites
White matter = myelinated axons
